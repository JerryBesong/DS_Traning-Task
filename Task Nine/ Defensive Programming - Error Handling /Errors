# This example program is meant to demonstrate errors.
 
# There are some errors in this program. Run the program, look at the error messages, and find and fix the errors.

print("Welcome to the error program") # SyntaxError: Missing parentheses() in call to 'print'
print("\n") # IndentationError and SyntaxError (wasnt supposed to have a space like an indentation space)(missing parenthesis)

    # Variables declaring the user's age, casting the str to an int, and printing the result
age_Str = 24 # IndentationError was fixed and also you cannot use double '==' in creating a variable
age = int(age_Str) # IndentationError was fixed also
print(f"I'm {age} years old.") # TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str

    # Variables declaring additional years and printing the total years of age
years_from_now = 3   # unexpected indentation was fixed also turning the variable to an int by removing the colon.
total_years = age + years_from_now    # unexpected indentation was fixed

print(f"The total number of years: {total_years}")  # SyntaxError: Missing parentheses() in call to 'print'

# Variable to calculate the total amount of months from the total amount of years and printing the result

total_months = total_years * 12 + 6  

print(f"In 3 years and 6 months, I'll be {total_months} months old")    # SyntaxError: Missing parentheses() in call to 'print'

# i ran into a logical error but was able to fix it using the hint given by adding the additional 6 months

#HINT, 330 months is the correct answer
